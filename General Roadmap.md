In this general roadmap, I list the key areas in the field of Data Science and their respective subtopics.
I will update this note once I feel that my list is extensive enough. The areas include programming, mathematics, data wrangling,
machine learning, and deep learning. To develop a data science mind it is essential to first start developing programming skills.
Mathematics (statistics and probability being key) is also crucial to practice. As a data scientist, mathematical thinking will
help you in developing your models. Once you feel more comfortable in programming and math for data science, you can start playing
with data and familiarise yourself with the standard procedures (think of data cleaning, exploratory analysis etc.).
